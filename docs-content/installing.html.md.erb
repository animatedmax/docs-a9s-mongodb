##<a id='errands'></a>Run BOSH Errands

The following BOSH errands are available, but should only be run when necessary.

### Run BOSH Configurator
This errand configures *a9s BOSH for PCF* so that it can provision MongoDB
service instances. In detail, this means uploading the required
stemcells in the BOSH release. Deactivating this errand could speed up the
deployment of all tiles.

<p class="note">To ensure your configuration remains up-to-date, disable this errand only when necessary.</p>

### Run Template Uploader
This errand is required to configure generic components
that are included in a9s MongoDB for PCF with MongoDB specific configurations.
Deactiviting this errand could speed up the deployment of all tiles.

<p class="note">To ensure your configuration remains up-to-date, disable this errand only when necessary.</p>

### Run Broker Registrar
This errand registers the a9s MongoDB for PCF service broker
at the Elastic Runtime. This causes the service be available in the Elastic Runtime
marketplace.

### Run Broker Deregistrar
This will deregister the a9s MongoDB for PCF service broker at the Elastic Runtime and thus removes the a9s MongoDB service
from the Elastic Runtime marketplace.
