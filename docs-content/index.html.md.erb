owner: Partners
---

The a9s MongoDB for PCF service enables the **on-demand provisioning of VM based dedicated
MongoDB servers and clusters**. Depending on the chosen service plan, a service
instance is represented by a single, dedicated virtual machine or a set of VMs
consisting of multiple (e.g. three) virtual machines comprising a MongoDB
replica set cluster. The provisioning of MongoDB service instances including the
virtual machine orchestration is entirely automated. This way **service instances
are highly isolated** and shielded by proven infrastructure virtualization
mechanisms.

Due to the on-demand provisioning on virtual machines, only existing service
instances allocate infrastructure resources which will be released when service
instances are destroyed. More than this, with on-demand provisioning **the number of
service instances is not limited by design**.

**Spread across several infrastructure availability zones**, the clustered data
service plans enable very **short failover times** and a **strong resilience against
failures** of individual infrastructure host or even entire availability zones.


This means that whenever a user executes ```cf create-service a9s-mongodb ...```,
dedicated virtual machines are created for this service instance. This allows
the **best possible bad neighborhood protection**.
